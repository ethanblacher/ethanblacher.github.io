    "section": "",
    "text": "The modern state of Israel is the triumphant story of a nation reclaiming their ancient homeland after a 2,000 year hiatus.  The Jewish people’s miraculous return to Israel was the realization of a dream sustained through exiles, massacres, pogroms, and holocausts.  Although the Jewish people’s journey of redemption and self determination should be lauded for defying the odds, it is often chastised and castigated by the media and global powers. Israel is accused of colonizing Palestine, oppressing Palestinians, and other reprehensible crimes. Although none of these claims are accurate, it is necessary to mention that Palestinians are suffering and have been the subject of great injustices. However, the root of their trials and tribulations are not due to Israel but rather their own government.\nWhen the British inherited the mandate of Palestine in the early 1920’s much of Palestine was uninhabited, as the land lacked government, infrastructure and fertile soil. Arab farmers were subject to heavy taxes and often looted by Bedouins, which basically erased their already meager yields. This perfect storm made many farmers desperate to sell their land and move to richer, neighboring Arab countries. Despite the dirt cheap prices Jews were offered for the land, David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, went as far as to say, “under no circumstances must we touch land belonging to fellahs or worked by them”. The early Jewish settlers were very cautious not to take land belonging to farmers, and rather elected to buy land from Arab landowners who owned enormous plots of land but lived overseas (Aumann). Rather than pay its market value, Jews paid steep premiums to eradicate any possibility that they were swindling Arabs, as it was apparent that the Jews were getting ripped off.\nIn 1947 the United Nations approved the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab territories, beginning a vicious cycle of constant violence.  The contrasting approaches of both military powers has been apparent in every war, most notably in the Gaza wars.  After the second intifada, the UN released a report, known as the Goldstone report, which morally equated Hamas and Israel.  The egregious position espoused by Goldstone was filled with inaccuracies and assumptions, so much so that Goldstone had to recant his entire report and apologize  (Goldstone). Goldstone originally failed to acknowledge the not so subtle nuance between killing innocent civilians on purpose and killing innocent civilians on accident. Hamas, the government of Gaza, fired nonstop rockets into Israel targeting urban centers in an attempt to kill as many Israelis as possible. Conversely, Israel launched targeted strikes against Palestinian terror centers, and sometimes innocent people were caught in the crossfire as a consequence of war.  Israel quickly launched an investigation whenever civilians were killed in an effort to try to make sure it didn’t happen again. Hamas on the other hand never self reflected on their actions despite the fact that they are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians.\nA few years after the notorious Goldstone report there was another flare up on the Gaza border. The skirmish between Israel and Gaza in 2014 is thoroughly documented by the High Level Military Group, who compiled a thorough report on the events. Their findings are clear, with Israel going to further extremes to protect Palestinians than their own government. Hamas repeatedly put their civilians in danger, using them as human shields and deterrents because they knew Israel wouldn’t kill innocent people. For example, during the war Hamas’s main headquarters were in al-Shifra hospital, a blatant violation of the Laws of Armed Conflict (High Level Military Group). Hamas’s actions stand in stark contrast to Israel. For example, before Israel is going to blow up a building used for terrorist activities, they make sure no one in the building. Israel sends texts, phone calls, leaflets, radio announcements, and more. Then, before the strike Israel gives a ‘knock on the roof’, which is a small explosive that doesn’t do damage to the structure but makes a loud noise to alert anyone who hasn’t left yet. To put it mildly, it is chilling that in the midst of a war Israel showed more care for Palestinians than their own government, whose duty should be to ensure their safety.\nIsrael’s moral conscience transcends just the physical acts of war and includes the inevitable consequences of war. Although the Geneva convention established caring for prisoners of war as an international mandate, that law is not abided by Middle Eastern countries when that prisoner is an Israeli. On the other hand, Israel treats injured Arab soldiers in the same manner they treat their own soldiers. Whether they are Palestinean, Egyptian, Jordanian or Syrian, Israel offers medical attention to those who need it indiscriminately (Silberman). Israel doesn’t just confine its medical efforts to the U.N.’s requirements, but habitually goes above and beyond what the law requires. A prime example is in Syria, where a civil war has ravaged the country and left millions of people injured and homeless. The effects of the war have been devastating, causing many refugees to flee to Israel seeking treatment for the assortment of trauma and wounds they have incurred. Rather than turn them away due to the tense relations between the two countries, Israel has embraced them with open arms.  Israel has even established a special hospital on its border to ensure Syrians have instantaneous access to medical attention (Sudilovsky).\nAlthough Israel isn’t always able to meet the sky high standard it has set for itself, it is super self reflective and critical.  One instance where Israel fell short in their conduct was in the case of Elor Azaria, an IDF soldier who shot a ‘nuetralized’ Palestinian terrorist (Korn).  Rather than sweep this under the rug or give Azaria a light slap on the wrist, this case was brought to the forefront of the nation. Azaria was ultimately convicted of manslaughter, a major statement to the rest of the country for the repercussions of violating the IDF’s sacred code of conduct. Israel’s court system is amongst the best in the world, as U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan stated, “It may well be Israel, not the United States, that provides the best hope for building a jurisprudence that can protect civil liberties against the demands of national security” (Dershowitz 187). Israel’s contemplative character has pursued justice over safety, prioritizing human dignity over national security. Israel made a giant leap for mankind when Israeli court became the first court to outlaw the use of non lethal torture on its prisoners, an effective method of gaining crucial security information (Dershowitz 185). While Israel continues to push the envelope for social justice in the Middle East, Hamas has a very different approach. Hamas tortures civilians without so much as a trial, and if the victim doesn’t cooperate they torture their family and freinds.\nIsrael’s democracy and Gaza’s dictatorship have yielded vastly different outcomes for its respected populations. Although Israel is constantly faced with existential threats by its neighbors, it has built a robust military, unparalleled court system and boasts a booming economy. Meanwhile, Gaza is more of a mess than ever, with its citizens not having access to clean water and the government stealing humanitarian aid to advance its terrorist efforts. At the end of the day both populations are suffering greatly from this ongoing conflict, and it is important to identify the crux of the issue in order for both sides to heal and move forward.\nAnnotated Bibliography\nAumann, Moshe. LAND OWNERSHIP IN PALESTINE, 1880–1948. The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute, www.myjli.com/survival/index.php/2017/03/26/land-ownership-in-palestine-1880-1948/.\nThis article details exactly who owned the land of Palestine prior to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.  A majority of the land was owned by wealthy, absentee Arab landlords, while a small portion was owned by local fellahin (famers) and Jews.  Many fellahin began to move to neighboring Arab states because in Palestine they were being taxed heavily, looted by Bedouins, tilling swampy land, suffering from a high infant mortality rate and lack of infrastructure.  Despite all the Arabs desperate to sell their property, Jews made a concerted effort to heavily compensate Palestinians from whom they bought land, which was often arid and malaria infested.  In 1944, a few years before Israel’s independence, Jews paid on average around $1,000 per acre of land in Palestine, while fertile soil in Iowa only cost approximately $110 per acre.  Additionally, Jews specifically bought land from Arabs who did not live in Palestine, rather than from the local fellahin in an attempt to not displace the local people. Although Palestine had typically been a country of emigration, the improved farming, economic, and health conditions resulting from the increase of Jewish landowners in Palestine led to an influx of Arabs into Palestine during the early 1900’s.  This article illustrates that Palestine was not ‘stolen’ from the Palestinian Arabs, but legally acquired by Jews in a very thoughtful and considerate manner.   \nDershowitz, Alan. “Is Israel the Prime Human Rights Violator in the world?” The Case for Israel, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2003, 181-188.\nIn the 28th chapter of his book defending the state of Israel’s right to exist, Dershowitz not only disputes the notion that Israel is a flagrant violator of human rights, but makes the case that Israel is a model of equality and justice.  Dershowitz’s main point centers around the fact that Israel places civil rights at the forefront of all decisions, even ahead of national security.  For example, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the IDF can’t attack ambulances even though there are ample documented cases of terrorists using ambulances to flee crime scenes.  The Israeli Supreme Court is so well respected that even Raji Sourani, the director of the Palestinean Center for Human Rights in Gaza stated that he is “constantly amazed by the high standards of the [Israeli] legal systems.”  Dershowitz discloses that the motive for writing this book was when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered Yassar Arafat, the President of the Palestinean Authority, basically everything he had asked for (in return for peace), yet his offer was swiftly rejected without so much as a counter.  Arafat’s calculated decision to resort to violence rather than attempt to make peace was because of his tried and true formula of terrorism, which garnered Palestinians international sympathy and attention, villifying Israel as bullies and agressors for acts of self defense.  This book, and the context with which it was written, bolster my paper by providing a clear example of a country doing everything within its power to do the right thing and make compromises, and an opposing government refusing to cooperate in the slightest.\nGoldstone, Richard. “Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and War Crimes.” The Washington Post, WP Company, 1 Apr. 2011, www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html.\nGoldstone wrote this op-ed as an apology for his infamous eponymous report for the United Nations Human Rights Council on the 2008-09 Gaza War.  The original report made the false accusation that Israel and Hamas were equally guilty in targeting innocent civilians and other war atrocities.  The report urged both parties to launch internal investigations or face international consequences.  While it is true that Hamas purposefully killed Israeli citizens–as their raison d’etre is to destroy the state of Israel–Israel never committed such heinous crimes.  Although during the war some innocent Palestinians were killed from Israeli artillery, Israel has been very remorseful and has launched numerous inquiries into these mistakes.  The prime example cited by Goldstone in his original report was an incident in which 29 Palestinians were killed in their home by IDF shelling.  This strike wasn’t an intentional attack on innocent Palestinian civilians as Goldstone initially claimed, rather an IDF commander incorrectly thought there was a drone, and is now under investigation. Unsurprisingly, Hamas has remained unapologetic and has not launched any internal investigations, because they have no intent on becoming more ethical and observant of international law.  This article highlights the vast ethical chasm between Hamas and Israel, yet the United Nations eagerness to equate the two.  \n“An Assessment of the 2014 Gaza Conflict.” High Level Military Group, October 2015.\nhttp://www.high-level-military-group.org/pdf/hlmg-assessment-2014-gaza-conflict.pdf\nThis lengthy report details all aspects of the 2014 Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The independent commision was compiled by former high level military officers from various countries and a former UN prosecutor.  The account offers heavy praise on how Israel handled the 2014 Gaza unrest, saying Israel “in some respects exceeded the highest standards we set for our own nations’ militaries” and “Some of the precautions were so extensive they worried that they could become norms in international law in terms of having to fight their own battles elsewhere”.  In contrast to the glowing review of Israel, they offer a scathing critique of Gaza and Hamas, remarking that “the entire military machinery of Hamas was embedded in civilian locations, private homes and a plethora of sensitive sites such as medical facilities, mosques and schools” and “Hamas actively sought the death of its own citizens [and] conducted a highly effective information campaign which included coercion of Gaza-based journalists”.  This damning report shows that Israel cares more about Palestinians than Hamas does, which is their own governing body.  \nKorn, Eugene. “Israel Caught between Emotions and the Law.” New Jersey Jewish News, 19 Jan.         2017. \nThis article describes the trial of Elor Azaria, an IDF soldier who killed Abdel Fattah al-Sharif, a Palestinian terrorist.  al-Sharif had just stabbed an Israeli soldier, and was immediately apprehended and pinned to the ground when Azaria came to the scene and shot him at point blank range.  Israel’s military court ruled that Azaria was guilty of manslaughter, as soldiers are only allowed to use weapons in cases of self defense and this was a flagrant violation of the IDF’s code of ethics.  The reaction of this case from Israel’s public was mixed, as Israel’s secular community applauded the high ethical standard, while Israel’s religious community was more hesitant.  Some of Israel’s religious population believe that terrorists should not be shown mercy, and found it unjust that a 20 year old kid was being punished for merely serving and protecting Israel.  Regardless of where one falls on the political aisle, this controversial case was monumental in setting a precedent that any action short of the IDF’s code of ethics is not just wrong but also a crime.  This article is an incredible voucher for the integrity of the Israeli court system and the self reflective nature of Israeli society.\nSudilovsky, Judith. “Treating the Enemy.” The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com, 27 May 2014, www.jpost.com/jerusalem-report/the-region/treating-the-enemy-354474.\nThis article discusses the peculiar relationship between Israelis and Syrians.  Although Israel and Syria are not friendly by any measure, due to Syria’s horrific civil war Israel has taken the initiative to treat injured Syrians, even undertaking operations where IDF soldiers put their lives at risk in search and rescue missions.  Since Israel saw that more and more Syrians were coming to the border seeking medical attention they built a makeshift hospital to treat and accommodate them.  The article documents the testimony of a Syrian grandmother who brought her grandchildren to Israel after they were severely injured in bombing attacks in their village.  She says that she always thought that “Israel wants to kill us, to murder us, but now Israel is being more merciful to us [than Syria]”.  The article stresses the plight of the rebels, who are not allowed medical treatment in Syria, and any doctor suspected of providing treatment is subject to death.  This article portrays Israel in a very positive light, doing anything within their power to help the Syrians.  \nSilberman, Justin, et al. “Caring for Enemy Soldiers a Fundamental IDF Value.” Baltimore Jewish Times, 6 July 2017, www.jewishtimes.com/63759/caring-for-enemy-soldiers-a-fundamental-idf-value/opinion\nThis article unpacks the cognitive dissonance experienced by Itzhak Brook, a former IDF medic during the 1967 Six Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  Brook recalls that during the first three days of the Six Day War he took care of over 500 wounded soldiers, many of them being Jordanian or Egyptian, the very people who were attempting to wipe Israel off of the face of the earth.  However, prior to viewing them as the enemy he viewed them as human beings, and gave them the same medical attention he gave Israelis despite his qualms.  The opposing soldiers were frightened when Brook cared for them, becuase they had been indoctrinated by anti-semitic rhetoric and knew that Israeli prisoners of war were treated in a very different fashion.  Brook closes his piece by urging those whom he treated to be champions for peace and use their testimonies to illustrate that coexisting with Israelis is possible and can even be beneficial."

    "text": "As an avid ice cream enthusiast, I often found myself in the frozen section of my local grocery store, contemplating which dairy treat I would enjoy next. The bright fluorescent bulbs bathed the names of the numerous brands and flavors in a golden glow, each one seemingly pleading its case to be eaten. Raspberry cheesecake, s’mores, and chocolate fudge brownie all called my name, but the loudest call of all was always chocolate chip cookie dough. Chocolate chip cookie dough was like a best friend, for it was always there for me (buried in my freezer) and never failed to make me feel better when I needed it most.\nHowever, my relationship with ice cream experienced tremendous turmoil at the start of my sophomore year when I was diagnosed with celiac disease. When people with celiac disease eat gluten, their small intestine is attacked, making them unable to absorb important nutrients, which can lead to severe health issues and complications. My doctor informed me that I had the most severe case of celiac he had ever seen and if I didn’t immediately stop eating gluten, I would be at an extremely high risk of cancer before turning 20.\nIn merely a few hours my whole life was turned upside down; I was forbidden to indulge in my favorite foods: never again could I devour piles of pasta, inhale sixteen inch pizza pies, or scarf down pints of cookie dough ice cream. I was devastated. That night I found myself back in the formerly friendly confines of the supermarket’s frozen section. However, no flavors that looked good were gluten free (GF) and no gluten free flavors looked good. I was sullenly dragging my feet down the aisle when I spotted a delectable looking cookie dough package with a GF sticker plastered across its packaging. Instantly, I remembered that sitting on the third shelf of our pantry behind the menorah was an old ice cream maker. In that moment I realized I had two choices: I could either feel sorry for myself or I could adapt. I bought the GF cookie dough, heavy cream, vanilla extract, granulated sugar and whole milk: all the ingredients I needed to make ice cream. I ran home and pulled out the dusty machine. I was not much of a cook, in fact I had hardly cooked anything besides packaged risotto, so this experience was both new and empowering. I mixed the ingredients together carefully, froze my creation for two hours, and paced the kitchen. When my timer went off I delicately placed my spoon in the melting dairy treat and took a taste. It was delicious. With each bite that followed, I felt more and more confident that all I needed was a positive attitude. Stepping out of my comfort zone could be as easy as pie… or cookie dough. I was forever changed by ice cream.\nBefore making my GF chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, I thought my ice-cream-craving heart would be forever broken. Instead, I was able to begin my new chapter of being gluten free with an enhanced and strengthened relationship with ice cream. Now, ice cream is my inspiration. I saunter down the frozen section, eyeing my former delights, and dream of what I can whip up next."

    "title": "Jewish National Fund ‘Greenwashing’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Environmentalism and Judaism have deep roots, traceable all the way back to the inception of the Jewish people. A prime example of Judaism’s dedication to preserving the environment comes from one of the greatest rabbinic sages, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai, who remarked, “If you have a sapling in your hand and someone tells you the Messiah has arrived, first plant the sapling and then go out to welcome the Messiah”. The importance of planting trees on this planet, even the smallest seedlings, takes precedence over greeting the person who will usher in the utopian ‘world to come’. Judaism’s deeply ingrained sense of awe and responsibility for the natural world spurned early Zionists leaders to ponder the environmental impact they wanted to have when they returned to their ancient homeland. This sentiment culminated with the birth of the Jewish National Fund.\nThe Jewish National Fund, also referred to as Keren Kayemet LeYisrael in Hebrew, is a non-profit organization that was founded at the Fifth Zionist Congress in 1901 by the father of modern Zionism, Theodore Herzl. The Jewish National Fund begun by purchasing land in Ottoman ruled Palestine from absentee Arab landlords, usually paying a steep premium for those lands. The Jewish National Fund made a concerted effort to heavily compensate Palestinians from whom they bought land, which was often arid and malaria infested. In 1944, a few years before Israel’s independence, Jews paid on average around $1,000 per acre of land in Palestine, while fertile soil in Iowa only costed approximately $110 per acre. Additionally, Jews specifically bought land from Arabs who did not live in Palestine, rather than from the local fellahin (farmers). David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, went as for as to say, “under no circumstances must we touch land belonging to fellahs or worked by them”. Slowly but surely the Jewish National Fund amassed a small fortune of land in the British Mandate of Palestine, and in 1939 10% of the entire Israeli Jewish population lived on Jewish National Fund owned land. That same year, Britain’s prime minister, Neville Chamberlin, instituted quotas on Jewish land acquisition and Jewish immigration. Despite the British White Paper, the Jewish National Fund continued to gradually buy land where it was permitted. Following the United Nations Partition Plan (Resolution 181) and Israel’s subsequent War of Independence, the Jewish National Fund began to procure and develop tremendous amounts of land, and currently owns 13% of the land in Israel. Since its commencement more than a century ago, the Jewish National Fund has blossomed from an idea into a reality, having a significant impact in shaping Israel’s ecological landscape.\nAccording to the Environmental Justice Atlas, the intent of the Jewish National Fund’s afforestation projects is to “hide the ethnic cleansing of those Palestinians whose home it was, and to prevent Palestinians from returning to their homes.” However, these claims are both misleading and false for multiple reasons. The accusation of a Palestinian ‘ethnic cleansing’ is common rhetoric that is used in attempt to defame Israel. The truth of the matter is that on May 14, 1948 David Ben-Gurion declared statehood, re-establishing a Jewish state in Israel after a nearly 2,000 year hiatus. Immediately after Ben-Gurion declared independence Israel was attacked by five countries, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, a high ranking Egyptian emissary and politician stated, “This will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades”. In a war of self defense, Israel ultimately prevailed against its Arab neighbors and prevented their attempted genocide of Israeli Jews. One consequence of the war was that roughly 700,000 Palestinians were displaced, a tragedy whose ramifications are still felt today. Although this is a complicated issue in which both the Israelis and Arab countries are at fault, the Environmental Justice Atlas emphatically places the blame solely on Israel. While some Palestinians were expelled by the Haganah (Israeli army), a substantial amount were encouraged to relocate and even ordered to evacuate by the invading countries. The prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, said that the Arab armies, “forced them to emigrate and to leave their home-land and the threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live.” The Environmental Justice Atlas’s endeavor to manipulate and politicize the suffering of the Palestinian people in an effort to demonize Israel is morally reprehensible and disingenuous.\nIn an effort to redeem Israel’s dry and barren terrain, the Jewish National Fund was forced to be creative. The Jewish National Fund is a strong proponent of geo-engineering, as it is responsible for planting over 250 million trees, constructing more than 200 dams and reservoirs, and creating over 1,000 parks. While the need for geo-engineering is becoming more dire around the globe, countries such as the Netherlands and Israel are pioneers in the field, and are implementing geo-engineering in their respective societies on large scales. However, while the Netherland’s Benthemplein Square is lauded for being ‘innovative’, ‘attractive’, and ‘inspiring,’ Israel is excoriated. It is alleged that the Jewish National Fund is culpable for ‘greenwashing’, which is using environmental prowess and accomplishments to minimize injustices occurring elsewhere within the society. Israel is no stranger to these types of allegations, as it is often accused of similar offenses such as ‘pinkwashing’, where critics lambast Israel for exploiting its robust LGBTQ community in order to conceal its human rights violations. A large reason why Israel is castigated for being so environmentally friendly and innovative is due to the messy past of the environmental movement. Environmentalism has an atrocious history of racism, sexism, and classism, issues that still persist today. For instance, a couple of the most notable and influential conservationists, John Muir and Aldo Leopold, were bigoted white males with extremely racist ideologies. While it is completely legitimate and valid to be cautiously suspicious of environmental movements and their motives, the skepticism coupled with the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict has led many environmentalists and humanitarians to the inaccurate conclusion that Israel is guilty of ‘greenwashing’. The Jewish National Fund is the realization of the Zionist dream, which is the self determination of the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland. This mission does not impede on the Palestinian, Druze, Bedouin and other indigenous peoples who regard Israel as their native land. It is abundantly clear that although the Jewish National Fund is in a precarious situation due to the conflicting claims to the land, it does not have an oppressive agenda and has taken appropriate steps in acting as ethically as possible.\nThe Environmental Justice Atlas also proclaims that Israel is developing the Negev (southern, desert region of Israel) at the “expense of more than 150,000 Palestinian Bedouin, whose ‘unrecognised’ villages, as a direct result of Israel’s policies, already lack electricity, running water and sewage disposal.” The Bedouins are Israel’s poorest people, with more than half of Bedouin workers earning the minimum wage or lower. This is largely due to the fact that the Negev is Israel’s most impoverished region and much of the land has been developed into military sites and national parks. Furthermore, high unemployment, drug and crime rates among the Bedouins are exacerbating their economic plight. However, the myriad of issues plaguing the Bedouins does not stem from the Jewish National Fund, and the Jewish National Fund is taking multiple steps to alleviate the hardships the Bedouin people encounter. During the summer of 2014, Gaza bombarded Israel with heavy rocket fire, with Bedouins occasionally caught up in the crossfire. The Jewish National Fund responded to the bombings by creating programing and bomb shelters to help calm and keep Bedouin children safe. Additionally, since the Bedouins live in a region of Israel that contains only 8% of its total population, there is a lack of resources and services. In an effort to combat the lack of hospitals deep in the Negev, the Jewish National Fund built a medical center to ensure the Bedouins get the treatment they need.\nOne of the hallmarks of the Jewish National Fund has been its vast afforestation projects, which serve a crucial environmental role. Carbon dioxide rates are currently the highest (over 400 parts per million) in human history and show no indication of slowing down (as illustrated by the Keeling Curve), especially due to the loss of carbon sinks via deforestation and rising ocean temperatures. The Jewish National Fund is the main reason why Israel is one of the only nations in the world to have more trees now than a hundred years ago, a remarkable achievement especially in a region that is regularly plagued by drought. Due to the relatively scare natural resources of the Levant, Israel’s manmade forests serve as vital carbon sinks in addition to agricultural land for the local populations. One of the populations that derives substantial benefit from the Yatir Forest (the largest planted forest in Israel) are the Bedouins, who utilize the forest for crops, grazing for their livestock, and as a source of income. Contrary to popular belief, the Jewish National fund has partnered extensively with Bedouins in the Yatir Forest, providing much needed assistance to the underprivileged minority. For example, Bedouins are permitted to let their herds graze on the plentiful pastures at a heavily discounted rate, with experts estimating that Bedouin herders save up to $56,637 (USD) in flock expenses. Although the grazing arrangement may not make sense for Israel from an economic standpoint, the herds play an important role in eating undergrowth vegetation, providing vital fire control. Additionally, Bedouins in Hebron use the Yatir Forest to harvest wild artichokes, hyssop, and firewood. Wild artichoke is a crucial crop for the Palestinian Bedouins, as when they are in season they can net a collector up to $64 (USD) a day, double the wage of some professional occupations in Hebron. Although it is technically illegal, the Israeli’s turn a blind eye to the reapers, and the artichoke has been coined ‘green gold’ due to its high profit margins and widespread availability. Overall, the Yatir Forest is responsible for over $300,000 (USD) worth of income for the Bedouin community residing in the Negev and in Hebron. Although $300,000 may seem relatively insignificant when compared to the 28,000 Bedouin population in these regions, the Yatir Forest offers consistent economic and resource insurance, which is essential in a war-ravaged country.\nReferences:\n1  Shabtai Teveth, Ben-Gurion and the Palestinian Arabs: From Peace to War, (London: Oxford University Press, 1985), p. 32.\n2  Kershnar, Sara, et al. “Introduction.” Jewish National Fund - Colonizing Palestine Since 1901, International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, 2011, pp. 4.\n3  “The First Arab-Israeli War.” Righteous Victims: a History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998, by Benny Morris, Alfred A.

    "title": "Adult Sea Turtles and Predation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary:\nAlthough adult sea turtles are rarely killed by predators in the open ocean, predation risk still has a big impact on their behavior. Sea turtles routinely avoid areas where predators lurk and hence their feeding patterns are largely shaped based off of where they think predators are, regardless of whether they actually are there or not. A couple studies have indicated that perhaps sea turtles are not getting adequate nutrition due to the perceived risk of predators in the general vicinity, but the results are far from conclusive. In order to better protect sea turtles it is essential to have a better understanding of their relationship with predators, which can be accomplished by devoting more resources towards studying the dynamics between sea turtles and their main predator: the tiger shark.\nIntroduction:\nSea turtles face a plethora of threats, resulting in six out of the seven species listed as either vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered, with the flatback turtle not fitting into these criterion because it has an insufficient amount of data (IUCN, 2022). Sea turtle populations are declining due to acute risks such as hunting and overfishing along with pernicious effects like pollution and climate change (Sea Turtle Conservancy, 2022). Another danger facing sea turtles is temperature dependent sex determination (TSD), which basically means that the sex of turtle eggs is more influenced by incubation temperatures than genetics. Rising temperatures could spell disaster for sea turtles, as hotter temperatures will breed a disproportionate amount of females. Most of the main threats facing sea turtles are anthropogenically induced, and it looks like sea turtles numbers may continue to decrease as the world warms.\nJustification:\nThe research between sea turtles and their predators often focuses on sea turtle eggs and infants due to their ultra-low survival rate and vulnerability. Since sea turtles eggs are such common prey coupled with the fact that many nascent sea turtles don’t survive to see adulthood, the research on adult sea turtle’s predator relation has largely been ignored. The greatest predator to adult sea turtles over the past few hundred years by far have been humans, however not much is known about the relationship between adult sea turtles and their other natural predators. There are a few reasons why there is not that much research on adult sea turtles and predation, with the main one being that there is an inverse relationship between sea turtle size and mortality. The larger sea turtles grow the less susceptible they are to predators due to their ‘size refuge’, increased experience, and safer living environments.\nOne of the most vulnerable times for an adult sea turtle, specifically females, is when they are nesting. On land sea turtles have limited mobility and are sitting ducks for predators, which range from jaguars in South America to crocodiles in Australia. Although these imposing predators are capable of turtle massacres—as evidenced by a Suriname jaguar who killed 13 green turtles over just a couple days—their impact on sea turtle populations is still very small (Heithaus, M. R., Wirsing, A. J, et al., 2008).\nIn the ocean, adult sea turtles have very few predators, with sharks being the main danger. Although occasionally a bull shark or white shark will attack a sea turtle, tiger sharks are their most common predator. Tiger sharks are the perfect sea turtle predator because of their combination of jagged teeth, wide mouth, and immense size—growing an average of 12 feet and weighing over 1,000 pounds. Furthermore, tiger sharks largely reside in tropical and temperate warm water environments, which is also where a majority of sea turtles live. Turtles are a staple of the tiger shark diet, and studies examining the stomachs of tiger sharks have increased scientists’ understanding of their relationship. For example, out of 22 random tiger sharks sampled in the Philippines, 11 had hawksbill remains in their stomach (Heithaus, M. R., Wirsing, A. J, et al., 2008). Additionally, across the globe in Western Australia turtles were found in the stomachs of more than 70% of the largest sharks sampled (Heithaus, M. R., Wirsing, A. J, et al., 2008). While there are a few other sea animals which have been documented killing sea turtles, such as orcas and monk seals, attacks are so rare they don’t pose a real threat.\nThe relationship between sea turtles and tiger sharks have a massive impact on ecosystems, and new research has shed light on the exact nuances of their relationship. In 2007 behavioral ecologists launched a study in Australia to determine if the mere presence of tiger sharks served as a deterrent for foraging turtles. This study had massive ecological implications because sea turtles play an important role in seagrass chemical composition and the detrital cycle (Heithaus, M. R., Frid, A., et al., 2007). Since sea turtles have such a large impact on sea grass, which acts not only as a natural carbon sink but the foundation of marine ecosystems, where they graze is essential to a plethora of marine organisms across trophic levels.\nThe area studied in Western Australia is home to ample seagrass and a large population of green turtles who have no predators except for tiger sharks, which are common from September-May but absent from June-August (Heithaus, M. R., Frid, A., et al., 2007). Risk of predation for turtles is highest in the middle of shallow banks because they are the furthest from deep water, where they can outmaneuver tiger sharks. However, the quality and quantity of seagrass is highest in the middle of these banks, facing sea turtles with the choice of risk and satiation or safety and hunger. Researchers compared turtle foraging behavior during summer and winter and found that turtles spent more time on the edge during summer (when sharks were abundant). Furthermore, researchers subdivided the sea turtle behavior by health and found that healthy sea turtles were very risk averse while unhealthy sea turtles took more risks. This is not the only instance of predation shaping sea turtles’ environments, as green turtles also feed in shallow lava beaches in Hawaii and shallow waters with ample mangrove protection in the Everglades (Wyneken, J., et al., 2013).\nConclusion:\nThese studies shows that predation risk (as opposed to actual predation) is one of the biggest threats for adult sea turtles. Furthermore, while conventional wisdom explains the decreasing number of turtles due to food scarcity, it is actually much more likely that it is from predation risk. For example, after the extinction of wolves in the western United States white tailed deer populations substantially increased, despite the fact that wolf predation was relatively low (Heithaus, M. R., Wirsing, A. J, et al., 2008). In order to best manage sea turtle population, scientists will need to continue to monitor tiger shark populations as well, as it seems there is an intimate relationship between them. Although there have been a few studies documenting the relationship between turtles and tiger sharks, the research is limited and the sample sizes are small. Additionally, research is predominantly centered around green sea turtles and sea grass, while other species such as hawksbill turtles have impacts on other ecosystems (coral reefs). The IUCN should devote special resources and funding into further exploring the relationship between tiger sharks and all species of sea turtles along with the environments they inhabit.\nCitation:\nHeithaus, M.

    "text": "For as long as I can remember I have followed a simple, but effective, formula: work hard, do well, repeat. It got me through school with good grades, respectable standardized test scores, and meaningful jobs and volunteer opportunities. Everything was going to plan, until the Dodgers lost the World Series.\nThe Dodgers were playing the Red Sox when my rabbi coaxed me into a bet. Although the Red Sox were the undisputed favorites, being a diehard Dodgers fan I was confident they would be able to defy the odds. The terms of the wager were as follows: if the Dodgers won the World Series my rabbi would take me to a steakhouse, where anything on the menu was fair game. If, however, the Red Sox won, I would have to learn an entire volume of Talmud, which is the primary rabbinic text of Jewish law and theology. I took the bet believing God was a Dodgers fan. It turned out, God preferred Talmud.\nTo my chagrin, the Red Sox easily defeated the Dodgers and I began studying Talmud. The experience was frustrating at first, with seemingly endless footnotes, abstract ideas, and complex debates. Yet, the very fact that everything about it was difficult actually compelled me to work even harder. Words, expressions, and arguments I may have passed over in other contexts suddenly and surprisingly became meaningful to me. I had to focus and consider everything. For the first time I found reward in the struggle, rather than in the outcome. I learned to love the intricacies of the Talmud so much that I brought the tome everywhere I went: to school, friends’ homes, and ultimately on a school trip to Poland.\nAs I walked among the 17,000 jagged stones that serve as a symbolic cemetery in honor of those murdered at Treblinka, I felt connected to the past in a way that I had never experienced before. I saw a stone with the word ‘Płock’ etched across the front. Płock was the Polish town where all my family lived before the Holocuast. I sat down alone on the damp pavement beside the stone with my Talmud. Being able to enjoy this sacred text in the same place where not long ago Jews were slaughtered for simply being Jewish was an empowering experience. It made me realize that I needed to rewrite my plans for college and the next chapter of my life.\nI had already applied, and been accepted, to several of my top choices. But as I sat pondering the past and my future, I felt a yearning to alter the journey I had so carefully planned. Just then a hand gently clutched my shoulder. I swiveled my head around and saw that it was my rabbi. We discussed the need for every person to find his or her own path. Unexpectedly, mine would take me to a gap a year in Jerusalem, where I will deepen my knowledge of Judaism, immerse myself in a different culture, and learn to be more independent before returning to college in the United States. At the end of our conversation my rabbi asked if we could study together. I placed the Talmud between us and replied, “You bet.”"

    "title": "Wildlife Farming: A Solution to Poaching",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Humans are currently entering the Sixth Mass Extinction, as extinction rates are more than 1,000 times the normal background rate. While there are a multitude of factors responsible for this tragedy, for mammals and birds the single largest contributor to biodiversity loss has been poaching. Although humans have hunted animals for their nutritional value for more than a million years, over the past few centuries animals have been slaughtered for ornamental and faux medicinal purposes, a practice known as poaching. Poaching has been most prominent in Africa, where a recent surge has caused iconic staples such as elephants and rhinos to teeter on the brink of extinction. Although at the beginning of the 20th century more than 10 million African elephants roamed the savannah, poachers have caused numbers to dwindle below 400,000. Additionally, between 2007 and 2014, rhino poaching in South Africa increased by 9,000%-decimating the largest rhino population in the world and causing local extinctions. Although poaching is most prevalent in Africa, it is a major issue in Asia as well. For example, the Asiatic Black Bear, Sun Bear, and Sloth Bear are all targeted for their bile and paws, which has caused their species to decline by roughly 50%.\nOne of the main reasons for the exponential increase in poaching is due to the burgeoning affluence of Asia, specifically China, which is by far the largest importer of poached goods. Fueled by economic growth rates of more than 7% compounded over the last 20 years, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam have chosen to spend their newfound wealth on animal products, which are central to Eastern cultures and traditions. Another reason for the rise in poaching is due to human encroachment on wild lands. Research has shown that one of the most telling indicators of increased poaching is the proximity of animal populations to cities and villages, with civilizations closer to wildlife typically poaching at higher levels. As transportation has evolved and human populations have boomed, humans have ventured further from big cities and closer to wildlife, a concerning trend that projects to intensify. \nMoreover, the growing relative poverty between urban and rural areas is contributing to poaching as well. While people in big cities are able to search a wide variety of sectors and industries to find employment, remote areas have much more limited options and opportunities, causing many to turn to poaching to earn a living. Studies have proven that in areas with high levels of poverty, there are also higher rates of poaching and exploitation of natural resources. Lastly, poaching has increased because of the growing financial incentives, as research has shown that prices are strongly correlated with the levels of poaching. For example, when the price of ivory increases, so does the level of elephant poaching, causing a positive feedback loop which drives poaching and prices.   \nPoaching does not only impact the animals that are killed, but has far reaching consequences on the rest of the ecosystem. As evidenced by wolves in Yellowstone National Park, when animals go extinct this can cause a chain reaction across the environment. When wolves were killed off in the 1920s, elk numbers exploded, and they overgrazed the grass and trees due to the lack of threat from predators. Since there were not enough trees for beavers to build dams, rivers and streams began to run faster and erode the soil along riverbanks, changing the shape and patterns of water flows across the park. Without trees alongside the riverbanks, beavers started to disappear, birds were unable to nest, and water temperatures became too hot (due to the lack of shade) for cold water fish. \nHowever, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995 and have played a crucial role in the revitalization of the park and its ecosystem. Although this is just one example, it is clear that species are deeply interconnected and that there can be lots of unexpected repercussions from the extinction of even just one species. Since bigger animals typically have an outsized impact on the environment, the fact that more than half of large terrestrial mammals (weighing more than 2,000 pounds) are facing extinction from poaching is cause for concern. Furthermore, when bigger animals go extinct, smaller animals tend to experience immense population growth. One group of animals that typically prospers in the absence of larger mammals is rodents, which are excellent at hosting and spreading diseases. This poses a significant threat to society because zoonotic diseases are responsible for some of the most prolific and deadly catastrophes in human history, such as the bubonic plague, malaria, and perhaps even Covid-19.\nPoaching is not only wrecking havoc on wildlife and ecosystems, but is fueling humanitarian crises around the world as well. A large portion of the 20 billion dollar wildlife trade market cap is captured by violent militias and extremist groups, such as al-Shabaab and the Lord\\’s Resistance Army. These groups use the proceeds from poaching to fund operations such as bloody civil wars and slave trade. Furthermore, African countries heavily rely on wildlife to attract tourists, which generates a large portion of their revenue. A recent survey of 31 African countries found that wildlife viewing accounted for 80% of trip sales for tour companies, and has a ripple effect on hospitality and customer service-based businesses. However, if animals go extinct, African countries would be at dangerously high risks of economic instability and potential collapse—which could further spiral war torn regions into chaos.\nOne viable solution to the poaching problem is wildlife farming, which originated during the agricultural revolution roughly 12,000 year ago. While conventional farming has subsisted of domesticated animals such as chickens and cows, it is imperative to begin farming exotic animals to combat poaching. An important case study showcasing the benefits of wildlife farming is illustrated by the African rhino. Rhinos were once abundant across Africa\\’s savannas, numbering half a million in the early 1900s, a figure which has since decreased nearly 95%. The rhinos precipitous drop off is not due to anthropogenic induced climate change, but rather human greed for their keratin horns. In an effort to protect rhinos, South Africa decided to ban the sale of rhino horns in 2009, which caused prices on the black market to skyrocket due to the depressed supply. This ironically attracted more poachers, as the surge in pricing incentivized poachers to kill more rhinos. Rhino horns became so expensive that citizens of Mozambique, a poor country that borders South Africa\\’s Kruger National Park, eagerly snuck across the border (despite a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers) because of the life-changing opportunity rhino horns presented.\nThe reason why rhino horns (along with nearly all poached artifacts) are so sought after is because they are Veblen goods. Veblen goods are high-end luxury item, such as jewelry and cars, whose demand is a direct result of their high price and status symbol—not their intrinsic value.  Although conventional economic theory posits that if supply increases quantity demanded will as well, this is not true with Veblen goods. Veblen goods violate the law of demand because decreases in price actually cause a decrease in quantity demanded up to a certain threshold. This is illustrated by the demand curve’s inverted shape, with a positive slope at high prices (which means consumption will increase as prices rise) and a negative slope at low prices (which means consumption will increases as prices decrease). The inflection point in the middle is an economic anomaly because the buyer will buy more at both a higher and lower price. Entrepreneur John Hume recognized the unique economic qualities of Veblen goods and preached that the only way to save rhinos was by domesticating them and selling their horns, which would bring more supply and liquidity to the market, lowering prices and de-incentivizing poachers. Hume attempted to shift the supply curve from above the inflection point (Supply~1~) to below (Supply~2~), which would lessen price and hopefully the quantity demanded. This is due to the fact that below the inflection point the public\\’s perception of rhino horns is very different than above, as it has lost its cachet of exclusivity.\nAlthough wildlife farming has not received much attention, countries have deployed a vast array of alternative strategies to decrease poaching, all of which have been unsuccessful. One approach to curb poaching has been to destroy the contraband, which has only exacerbated the issue. The economic effect of constricting an already restrained supply is that prices rise and quantity demanded increases, causing the complete opposite result of what was intended. Unfortunately, destroying poached artifacts (such as burning ivory) has become a way for countries with poor environmental records to virtue signal and attempt to expunge their involvement in the wildlife trade. For example, On March 3, 2015, the President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, burned 15 metric tonnes of ivory to celebrate World Wildlife Day. While this was a nice public gesture, Kenya would be better off allocating resources to protect their few live elephants rather than orchestrating a theatrical performance boasting about their environmental prowess.\nAnother approach to stop poaching has been establishing \\‘protected areas\\’, which is an ambiguous term that can mean a bunch of different things. Research suggests that simply designating areas as \\‘protected\\’ without any real action or enforcement barely reduces poaching. However, areas that had guards on the ground patrolling the area observed a dramatic decrease in poaching, more than 25%. Although a 25% decrease in poaching is nothing to scoff at, wildlife levels were still declining in those areas by 39% (as opposed to 65% in areas without protection). Furthermore, protecting areas is super expensive and often requires a trade-off of  paying for high-tech machinery rather than supporting impoverished communities. \nEven conservationists agree that merely protecting areas is not nearly enough to prevent poaching. In fact, esteemed wildlife trade researchers Dan Challender and Douglas C. MacMillan advocated for driving prices down rather than creating protection areas, because lower prices can better alleviate poaching pressures in the \\‘medium term\\’. As evidence for why wildlife farming is a better alternative than protection areas, Challender and MacMillan cited how crocodile farming in the 1900s reduced poaching even in areas with little to no governance.\nAnother method to stop poaching is via international diplomacy and legislation, such as CITES, which was enforced in 1975. CITES, which stands for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, designates which species can and can not be traded according to their population health. Although CITES is technically binding, countries often do not turn in their trading data, and when they do it often has inconsistencies. For example, although in 2010 China claimed it imported 130 ivory carving from Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe\\’s 2010 records stated that they exported 2,512 ivory carving to China. Although CITES is more than 40 years old, it has little to show for its work. \nWhile wildlife farming offers significant benefits to endangered species, there are a few potential consequences. One major concern is that farming does not fully solve the economic issue, as it is still cheaper (at least in the short term) to kill an animal in the wild rather than rear it. Farming requires significant upfront capital because there are tons of fixed costs, such as property, equipment, and salaries. Additionally, farmers need to pay for food, which can be super expensive when dealing with big animals that have voracious appetites. On the other hand, poaching is nearly free, as all the poacher needs is a weapon and transportation. Another potential drawback of farming is the risk of genetic modifications, such as inbreeding. Since animals in captivity presumably have a smaller pool of potential mates than in the wild, they are at a much higher risk of developing gene abnormalities and deformities. Also, due to the absence of selection pressure in captivity, vital survival traits that animals evolved over centuries can become obsolete and lost. Furthermore, farming inevitably causes behavioral changes as well. For example, some animals have immense trouble mating in captivity, such as the giant panda and cheetah, while others lose their fear of predators and the will to forage for food. Lastly, there are tremendous ethical issues regarding wildlife farming, as animals can be abused and exploited solely for profits rather than a joint social mission.\nWhile there is certainly no silver bullet for the poaching problem, wildlife farming may be humanities last hope at protecting endangered species. Wildlife farming floods the market with supply, causing reductions in prices and quantity demanded—de-incentivizing poachers and protecting animals. Besides for the financial benefits, wildlife farming could also provide immense social good, such as reducing zoonotic diseases, alleviating poverty pressures, and keeping industries which rely on wildlife in business. Additionally, legalizing wildlife trade would allow governments to impose a tax on farms and generate previously unrealized revenue, which would simultaneously deplete terrorist groups of their funds and could be used to aid poorer communities that relied on poaching. Although wildlife farming has a few shortcomings, it is a practical approach to begin saving animals immediately, because there is no time to waste.\nCitations\nChallender, Daniel W.
