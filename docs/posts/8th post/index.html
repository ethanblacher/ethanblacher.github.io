<p>In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Gawain encounters immense cognitive dissonance as he struggles with carnal temptations and religious observance. Although Gawain eventually succumbs to his vices, he tries to maintain his image of the utmost chivalrous knight by equating his predicament to those of pious biblical figures. While Gawain compares himself to prophets who were deceived by women in an effort to absolve himself of blame, the real similarities between Gawain and these figures lie in their sins, not their righteousness.</p>
<p>Prior to lamenting the fate of four biblical heroes (Adam, Samson, David and Solomon), Gawain begins his misogynistic tirade by projecting his humiliation of betraying Lord Bertilak upon women. Gawain remarks, “and by the wiles of woman to woe be brought” (2415), utilizing alliteration to deflect accountability. Alliteration is prevalent throughout the novella, and is intended to impress a connection between seemingly unrelated words, as Gawain does by placing “woman” between “wiles” and “woe”. Gawain carefully crafts this sentence to provide a chronological order of events, as the “wiles” (meaning ‘crafty or cunning’) of women precedes the “woe” (meaning ‘a state or condition of misery’) which men experience. The meaning of this line is not only embedded in the alliteration, but the sequence of the words as well. The arrangement of “wiles” before “woman”, which is followed by “woe”, conveys a causal relationship between the allure of women and the resulting misfortune.</p>
<p>Gawain continues his monologue by accusing Eve of tricking Adam into eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge, painting Adam as a victim rather than a willing participant. Although Gawain claims that Adam was “beguiled” (meaning ‘deluded or deceived’), in reality it was actually Eve who was misguided. While Eve was in the Garden of Eden she was approached by “the shrewdest of all wild beasts” (Genesis 3:1), a snake who convinces her to eat from the tree. After Eve eats from the tree she does not attempt to persuade Adam as the snake did to her, in fact she does not even utter a single word. Although Adam was privy to the dangers of eating from the tree and was not coerced like Eve, he consciously chooses to eat from the tree. Gawain intentionally misconstrues the story in an attempt to garner sympathy for himself and illustrate that women have been the bane of men ever since creation. Furthermore, when Adam is confronted by God for his sin he offers a similar excuse as Gawain, instantly blaming Eve.</p>
<p>Gawain concludes his sexist diatribe by holding Bathsheba accountable for David’s sin, blatantly perverting the text once again. David is punished harshly by God for his elicit relationship with Bathsheba because he commits a cardinal sin: adultery. David sees Bathsheba bathing from his rooftop and tells his servants to bring her to his palace, where he later impregnates her. When Gawain recounts the source of David’s affliction he uses an interesting choice of diction, describing David as being, “blinded by Bathsheba” (2419). Vision plays a central role in the story of David and Bathsheba, as David spies on Bathsheba from afar and is enamored by her beauty, which ultimately entices him to sin. David’s physical sight is intertwined with his moral blindness, as he chooses to overlook what he does not want to see, such as her marriage. Additionally, Gawain uses a similar sentence structure in line 2419 as he did in 2415, placing “Bathsheba” in the middle of “blinded” and “bitterly suffered”. Gawain’s constant positioning of women between words with negative connotations serves to reinforce the theme of this verbal onslaught—men condemning women in an effort to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that Gawain’s rant is so extensive and encompassing, it is puzzling that Gawain fails to mention Joseph the Prince of Egypt, as their character journeys are nearly identical. Both Gawain and Joseph leave their communities, embark on a journey in a foreign land, and are pursued by licentious women. However, although Gawain and Joseph encounter similar situations, their actions are diametrically opposed. Joseph faces many immense challenges in his life, yet despite his trials and tribulations he remains faithful to God and his masters. On the other hand, when Gawain faces adversity he abandons his belief in God and betrays his host.</p>
<p>After Joseph is sold into slavery he begins to work for an Egyptian aristocrat named Potiphar, who immediately notices Joseph’s burgeoning potential and gives him jurisdiction over his entire estate. However, Potiphar’s wife repeatedly attempts to seduce and harass Joseph, who stays loyal to his master and to God, as he says, “He [Potiphar] wields no more authority in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except yourself, since you are his wife. How then could I do this most wicked thing, and sin before God?” (Genesis 39:9). Joseph acknowledges that not only would sleeping with Potiphar’s wife be a heinous crime against Potiphar, but against God as well. While Jospeh ends up going to jail after he is falsely accused of rape, he is content knowing that he was just and ethical.</p>
<p>Similar to Joseph, Gawain is the guest of an outstanding host with a lustful wife. After successfully dodging a few of Lady Bertilak’s advancements, Gawain accepts her green girdle as a gift. Gawain agrees not to tell Lord Bertilak about the girdle, hence breaking their agreement of exchanging their daily winnings with one another. Gawain agrees to “on his honor hide it from her husband” (1863), a seemingly contradictory promise as “honor” means ‘an expression of strong assurance by which the speaker pledges his good faith’. Therefore, although Gawain gives Lady Bertilak his “honor”, he is not acting honorably, as he is inevitably simultaneously violating his commitment to Lord Bertilak. Additionally, the alliteration and juxtaposition of “honor” and “hide” is paradoxical, as someone who is truly honorable should have nothing to hide. Lastly, “honor” also refers to female genitals, as this transgression is akin to sleeping with Lady Bertilak.</p>
<p>Gawain’s acceptance of the girdle not only calls into question his honesty, but his belief in God as well. Part of the reason why Gawain was so enchanted by the girdle is because it offered supernatural protection powers, as “there is none so hardy under heaven that to hew him were able” (1853). Rather than turning to God for assistance in his confrontation with the Green Knight, as he had done when he was lost, Gawain places his faith into a magic girdle. Gawain’s accouterment exposes his innermost concerns, as his self-centeredness supersedes his word and religion. Although Gawain was heralded as the most faithful and chivalrous knight in all the land, his actions prove it to be a facade.</p>
