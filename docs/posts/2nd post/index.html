<pre><code>Humans are currently entering the Sixth Mass Extinction, as extinction rates are more than 1,000 times the normal background rate. While there are a multitude of factors responsible for this tragedy, for mammals and birds the single largest contributor to biodiversity loss has been poaching. Although humans have hunted animals for their nutritional value for more than a million years, over the past few centuries animals have been slaughtered for ornamental and faux medicinal purposes, a practice known as poaching. Poaching has been most prominent in Africa, where a recent surge has caused iconic staples such as elephants and rhinos to teeter on the brink of extinction. Although at the beginning of the 20th century more than 10 million African elephants roamed the savannah, poachers have caused numbers to dwindle below 400,000. Additionally, between 2007 and 2014, rhino poaching in South Africa increased by 9,000%---decimating the largest rhino population in the world and causing local extinctions. Although poaching is most prevalent in Africa, it is a major issue in Asia as well. For example, the Asiatic Black Bear, Sun Bear, and Sloth Bear are all targeted for their bile and paws, which has caused their species to decline by roughly 50%.

One of the main reasons for the exponential increase in poaching is due to the burgeoning affluence of Asia, specifically China, which is by far the largest importer of poached goods. Fueled by economic growth rates of more than 7% compounded over the last 20 years, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam have chosen to spend their newfound wealth on animal products, which are central to Eastern cultures and traditions. Another reason for the rise in poaching is due to human encroachment on wild lands. Research has shown that one of the most telling indicators of increased poaching is the proximity of animal populations to cities and villages, with civilizations closer to wildlife typically poaching at higher levels. As transportation has evolved and human populations have boomed, humans have ventured further from big cities and closer to wildlife, a concerning trend that projects to intensify.&nbsp;

Moreover, the growing relative poverty between urban and rural areas is contributing to poaching as well. While people in big cities are able to search a wide variety of sectors and industries to find employment, remote areas have much more limited options and opportunities, causing many to turn to poaching to earn a living. Studies have proven that in areas with high levels of poverty, there are also higher rates of poaching and exploitation of natural resources. Lastly, poaching has increased because of the growing financial incentives, as research has shown that prices are strongly correlated with the levels of poaching. For example, when the price of ivory increases, so does the level of elephant poaching, causing a positive feedback loop which drives poaching and prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Poaching does not only impact the animals that are killed, but has far reaching consequences on the rest of the ecosystem. As evidenced by wolves in Yellowstone National Park, when animals go extinct this can cause a chain reaction across the environment. When wolves were killed off in the 1920s, elk numbers exploded, and they overgrazed the grass and trees due to the lack of threat from predators. Since there were not enough trees for beavers to build dams, rivers and streams began to run faster and erode the soil along riverbanks, changing the shape and patterns of water flows across the park. Without trees alongside the riverbanks, beavers started to disappear, birds were unable to nest, and water temperatures became too hot (due to the lack of shade) for cold water fish.&nbsp;

However, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995 and have played a crucial role in the revitalization of the park and its ecosystem. Although this is just one example, it is clear that species are deeply interconnected and that there can be lots of unexpected repercussions from the extinction of even just one species. Since bigger animals typically have an outsized impact on the environment, the fact that more than half of large terrestrial mammals (weighing more than 2,000 pounds) are facing extinction from poaching is cause for concern. Furthermore, when bigger animals go extinct, smaller animals tend to experience immense population growth. One group of animals that typically prospers in the absence of larger mammals is rodents, which are excellent at hosting and spreading diseases. This poses a significant threat to society because zoonotic diseases are responsible for some of the most prolific and deadly catastrophes in human history, such as the bubonic plague, malaria, and perhaps even Covid-19.

Poaching is not only wrecking havoc on wildlife and ecosystems, but is fueling humanitarian crises around the world as well. A large portion of the 20 billion dollar wildlife trade market cap is captured by violent militias and extremist groups, such as al-Shabaab and the Lord\'s Resistance Army. These groups use the proceeds from poaching to fund operations such as bloody civil wars and slave trade. Furthermore, African countries heavily rely on wildlife to attract tourists, which generates a large portion of their revenue. A recent survey of 31 African countries found that wildlife viewing accounted for 80% of trip sales for tour companies, and has a ripple effect on hospitality and customer service-based businesses. However, if animals go extinct, African countries would be at dangerously high risks of economic instability and potential collapse---which could further spiral war torn regions into chaos.

One viable solution to the poaching problem is wildlife farming, which originated during the agricultural revolution roughly 12,000 year ago. While conventional farming has subsisted of domesticated animals such as chickens and cows, it is imperative to begin farming exotic animals to combat poaching. An important case study showcasing the benefits of wildlife farming is illustrated by the African rhino. Rhinos were once abundant across Africa\'s savannas, numbering half a million in the early 1900s, a figure which has since decreased nearly 95%. The rhinos precipitous drop off is not due to anthropogenic induced climate change, but rather human greed for their keratin horns. In an effort to protect rhinos, South Africa decided to ban the sale of rhino horns in 2009, which caused prices on the black market to skyrocket due to the depressed supply. This ironically attracted more poachers, as the surge in pricing incentivized poachers to kill more rhinos. Rhino horns became so expensive that citizens of Mozambique, a poor country that borders South Africa\'s Kruger National Park, eagerly snuck across the border (despite a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers) because of the life-changing opportunity rhino horns presented.

The reason why rhino horns (along with nearly all poached artifacts) are so sought after is because they are Veblen goods. Veblen goods are high-end luxury item, such as jewelry and cars, whose demand is a direct result of their high price and status symbol---not their intrinsic value.&nbsp; Although conventional economic theory posits that if supply increases quantity demanded will as well, this is not true with Veblen goods. Veblen goods violate the law of demand because decreases in price actually cause a decrease in quantity demanded up to a certain threshold. This is illustrated by the demand curve's inverted shape, with a positive slope at high prices (which means consumption will increase as prices rise) and a negative slope at low prices (which means consumption will increases as prices decrease). The inflection point in the middle is an economic anomaly because the buyer will buy more at both a higher and lower price. Entrepreneur John Hume recognized the unique economic qualities of Veblen goods and preached that the only way to save rhinos was by domesticating them and selling their horns, which would bring more supply and liquidity to the market, lowering prices and de-incentivizing poachers. Hume attempted to shift the supply curve from above the inflection point (Supply~1~) to below (Supply~2~), which would lessen price and hopefully the quantity demanded. This is due to the fact that below the inflection point the public\'s perception of rhino horns is very different than above, as it has lost its cachet of exclusivity.

Although wildlife farming has not received much attention, countries have deployed a vast array of alternative strategies to decrease poaching, all of which have been unsuccessful. One approach to curb poaching has been to destroy the contraband, which has only exacerbated the issue. The economic effect of constricting an already restrained supply is that prices rise and quantity demanded increases, causing the complete opposite result of what was intended. Unfortunately, destroying poached artifacts (such as burning ivory) has become a way for countries with poor environmental records to virtue signal and attempt to expunge their involvement in the wildlife trade. For example, On March 3, 2015, the President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, burned 15 metric tonnes of ivory to celebrate World Wildlife Day. While this was a nice public gesture, Kenya would be better off allocating resources to protect their few live elephants rather than orchestrating a theatrical performance boasting about their environmental prowess.

Another approach to stop poaching has been establishing \'protected areas\', which is an ambiguous term that can mean a bunch of different things. Research suggests that simply designating areas as \'protected\' without any real action or enforcement barely reduces poaching. However, areas that had guards on the ground patrolling the area observed a dramatic decrease in poaching, more than 25%. Although a 25% decrease in poaching is nothing to scoff at, wildlife levels were still declining in those areas by 39% (as opposed to 65% in areas without protection). Furthermore, protecting areas is super expensive and often requires a trade-off of&nbsp; paying for high-tech machinery rather than supporting impoverished communities.&nbsp;

Even conservationists agree that merely protecting areas is not nearly enough to prevent poaching. In fact, esteemed wildlife trade researchers Dan Challender and Douglas C. MacMillan advocated for driving prices down rather than creating protection areas, because lower prices can better alleviate poaching pressures in the \'medium term\'. As evidence for why wildlife farming is a better alternative than protection areas, Challender and MacMillan cited how crocodile farming in the 1900s reduced poaching even in areas with little to no governance.

Another method to stop poaching is via international diplomacy and legislation, such as CITES, which was enforced in 1975. CITES, which stands for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, designates which species can and can not be traded according to their population health. Although CITES is technically binding, countries often do not turn in their trading data, and when they do it often has inconsistencies. For example, although in 2010 China claimed it imported 130 ivory carving from Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe\'s 2010 records stated that they exported 2,512 ivory carving to China. Although CITES is more than 40 years old, it has little to show for its work.&nbsp;

While wildlife farming offers significant benefits to endangered species, there are a few potential consequences. One major concern is that farming does not fully solve the economic issue, as it is still cheaper (at least in the short term) to kill an animal in the wild rather than rear it. Farming requires significant upfront capital because there are tons of fixed costs, such as property, equipment, and salaries. Additionally, farmers need to pay for food, which can be super expensive when dealing with big animals that have voracious appetites. On the other hand, poaching is nearly free, as all the poacher needs is a weapon and transportation. Another potential drawback of farming is the risk of genetic modifications, such as inbreeding. Since animals in captivity presumably have a smaller pool of potential mates than in the wild, they are at a much higher risk of developing gene abnormalities and deformities. Also, due to the absence of selection pressure in captivity, vital survival traits that animals evolved over centuries can become obsolete and lost. Furthermore, farming inevitably causes behavioral changes as well. For example, some animals have immense trouble mating in captivity, such as the giant panda and cheetah, while others lose their fear of predators and the will to forage for food. Lastly, there are tremendous ethical issues regarding wildlife farming, as animals can be abused and exploited solely for profits rather than a joint social mission.

While there is certainly no silver bullet for the poaching problem, wildlife farming may be humanities last hope at protecting endangered species. Wildlife farming floods the market with supply, causing reductions in prices and quantity demanded---de-incentivizing poachers and protecting animals. Besides for the financial benefits, wildlife farming could also provide immense social good, such as reducing zoonotic diseases, alleviating poverty pressures, and keeping industries which rely on wildlife in business. Additionally, legalizing wildlife trade would allow governments to impose a tax on farms and generate previously unrealized revenue, which would simultaneously deplete terrorist groups of their funds and could be used to aid poorer communities that relied on poaching. Although wildlife farming has a few shortcomings, it is a practical approach to begin saving animals immediately, because there is no time to waste.</code></pre>
