<p>The modern state of Israel is the triumphant story of a nation reclaiming their ancient homeland after a 2,000 year hiatus.&nbsp; The Jewish people’s miraculous return to Israel was the realization of a dream sustained through exiles, massacres, pogroms, and holocausts.&nbsp; Although the Jewish people’s journey of redemption and self determination should be lauded for defying the odds, it is often chastised and castigated by the media and global powers.&nbsp; Israel is accused of colonizing Palestine, oppressing Palestinians, and other reprehensible crimes.&nbsp; Although none of these claims are accurate, it is necessary to mention that Palestinians are suffering and have been the subject of great injustices.&nbsp; However, the root of their trials and tribulations are not due to Israel but rather their own government. When the British inherited the mandate of Palestine in the early 1920’s much of Palestine was uninhabited, as the land lacked government, infrastructure and fertile soil.&nbsp; Arab farmers were subject to heavy taxes and often looted by Bedouins, which basically erased their already meager yields.&nbsp; This perfect storm made many farmers desperate to sell their land and move to richer, neighboring Arab countries.&nbsp; Despite the dirt cheap prices Jews were offered for the land, David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, went as far as to say, “under no circumstances must we touch land belonging to fellahs or worked by them”.&nbsp; The early Jewish settlers were very cautious not to take land belonging to farmers, and rather elected to buy land from Arab landowners who owned enormous plots of land but lived overseas (Aumann).&nbsp; Rather than pay its market value, Jews paid steep premiums to eradicate any possibility that they were swindling Arabs, as it was apparent that the Jews were getting ripped off. In 1947 the United Nations approved the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab territories, beginning a vicious cycle of constant violence.&nbsp; The contrasting approaches of both military powers has been apparent in every war, most notably in the Gaza wars.&nbsp; After the second intifada, the UN released a report, known as the Goldstone report, which morally equated Hamas and Israel.&nbsp; The egregious position espoused by Goldstone was filled with inaccuracies and assumptions, so much so that Goldstone had to recant his entire report and apologize&nbsp; (Goldstone).&nbsp; Goldstone originally failed to acknowledge the not so subtle nuance between killing innocent civilians on purpose and killing innocent civilians on accident.&nbsp; Hamas, the government of Gaza, fired nonstop rockets into Israel targeting urban centers in an attempt to kill as many Israelis as possible.&nbsp; Conversely, Israel launched targeted strikes against Palestinian terror centers, and sometimes innocent people were caught in the crossfire as a consequence of war.&nbsp; Israel quickly launched an investigation whenever civilians were killed in an effort to try to make sure it didn’t happen again.&nbsp; Hamas on the other hand never self reflected on their actions despite the fact that they are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years after the notorious Goldstone report there was another flare up on the Gaza border.&nbsp; The skirmish between Israel and Gaza in 2014 is thoroughly documented by the High Level Military Group, who compiled a thorough report on the events.&nbsp; Their findings are clear, with Israel going to further extremes to protect Palestinians than their own government.&nbsp; Hamas repeatedly put their civilians in danger, using them as human shields and deterrents because they knew Israel wouldn’t kill innocent people.&nbsp; For example, during the war Hamas’s main headquarters were in al-Shifra hospital, a blatant violation of the Laws of Armed Conflict (High Level Military Group).&nbsp; Hamas’s actions stand in stark contrast to Israel.&nbsp; For example, before Israel is going to blow up a building used for terrorist activities, they make sure no one in the building.&nbsp; Israel sends texts, phone calls, leaflets, radio announcements, and more.&nbsp; Then, before the strike Israel gives a ‘knock on the roof’, which is a small explosive that doesn’t do damage to the structure but makes a loud noise to alert anyone who hasn’t left yet.&nbsp; To put it mildly, it is chilling that in the midst of a war Israel showed more care for Palestinians than their own government, whose duty should be to ensure their safety. Israel’s moral conscience transcends just the physical acts of war and includes the inevitable consequences of war.&nbsp; Although the Geneva convention established caring for prisoners of war as an international mandate, that law is not abided by Middle Eastern countries when that prisoner is an Israeli.&nbsp; On the other hand, Israel treats injured Arab soldiers in the same manner they treat their own soldiers.&nbsp; Whether they are Palestinean, Egyptian, Jordanian or Syrian, Israel offers medical attention to those who need it indiscriminately (Silberman).&nbsp; Israel doesn’t just confine its medical efforts to the U.N.’s requirements, but habitually goes above and beyond what the law requires.&nbsp; A prime example is in Syria, where a civil war has ravaged the country and left millions of people injured and homeless.&nbsp; The effects of the war have been devastating, causing many refugees to flee to Israel seeking treatment for the assortment of trauma and wounds they have incurred.&nbsp; Rather than turn them away due to the tense relations between the two countries, Israel has embraced them with open arms.&nbsp; Israel has even established a special hospital on its border to ensure Syrians have instantaneous access to medical attention (Sudilovsky).&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Israel isn’t always able to meet the sky high standard it has set for itself, it is super self reflective and critical.&nbsp; One instance where Israel fell short in their conduct was in the case of Elor Azaria, an IDF soldier who shot a ‘nuetralized’ Palestinian terrorist (Korn).&nbsp; Rather than sweep this under the rug or give Azaria a light slap on the wrist, this case was brought to the forefront of the nation.&nbsp; Azaria was ultimately convicted of manslaughter, a major statement to the rest of the country for the repercussions of violating the IDF’s sacred code of conduct.&nbsp; Israel’s court system is amongst the best in the world, as U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan stated, “It may well be Israel, not the United States, that provides the best hope for building a jurisprudence that can protect civil liberties against the demands of national security” (Dershowitz 187).&nbsp; Israel’s contemplative character has pursued justice over safety, prioritizing human dignity over national security.&nbsp; Israel made a giant leap for mankind when Israeli court became the first court to outlaw the use of non lethal torture on its prisoners, an effective method of gaining crucial security information (Dershowitz 185).&nbsp; While Israel continues to push the envelope for social justice in the Middle East, Hamas has a very different approach.&nbsp; Hamas tortures civilians without so much as a trial, and if the victim doesn’t cooperate they torture their family and freinds. Israel’s democracy and Gaza’s dictatorship have yielded vastly different outcomes for its respected populations.&nbsp; Although Israel is constantly faced with existential threats by its neighbors, it has built a robust military, unparalleled court system and boasts a booming economy.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Gaza is more of a mess than ever, with its citizens not having access to clean water and the government stealing humanitarian aid to advance its terrorist efforts.&nbsp; At the end of the day both populations are suffering greatly from this ongoing conflict, and it is important to identify the crux of the issue in order for both sides to heal and move forward.</p>

<p>This article details exactly who owned the land of Palestine prior to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.&nbsp; A majority of the land was owned by wealthy, absentee Arab landlords, while a small portion was owned by local <em>fellahin</em> (famers) and Jews.&nbsp; Many <em>fellahin</em> began to move to neighboring Arab states because in Palestine they were being taxed heavily, looted by Bedouins, tilling swampy land, suffering from a high infant mortality rate and lack of infrastructure.&nbsp; Despite all the Arabs desperate to sell their property, Jews made a concerted effort to heavily compensate Palestinians from whom they bought land, which was often arid and malaria infested.&nbsp; In 1944, a few years before Israel’s independence, Jews paid on average around $1,000 per acre of land in Palestine, while fertile soil in Iowa only cost approximately $110 per acre.&nbsp; Additionally, Jews specifically bought land from Arabs who did not live in Palestine, rather than from the local <em>fellahin</em> in an attempt to not displace the local people<em>.</em> Although Palestine had typically been a country of emigration, the improved farming, economic, and health conditions resulting from the increase of Jewish landowners in Palestine led to an influx of Arabs into Palestine during the early 1900’s.&nbsp; This article illustrates that Palestine was not ‘stolen’ from the Palestinian Arabs, but legally acquired by Jews in a very thoughtful and considerate manner.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dershowitz, Alan. “Is Israel the Prime Human Rights Violator in the world?” <em>The Case for Israel</em>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2003, 181-188.</p>
<p>In the 28th chapter of his book defending the state of Israel’s right to exist, Dershowitz not only disputes the notion that Israel is a flagrant violator of human rights, but makes the case that Israel is a model of equality and justice.&nbsp; Dershowitz’s main point centers around the fact that Israel places civil rights at the forefront of all decisions, even ahead of national security.&nbsp; For example, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the IDF can’t attack ambulances even though there are ample documented cases of terrorists using ambulances to flee crime scenes.&nbsp; The Israeli Supreme Court is so well respected that even Raji Sourani, the director of the Palestinean Center for Human Rights in Gaza stated that he is “constantly amazed by the high standards of the [Israeli] legal systems.”&nbsp; Dershowitz discloses that the motive for writing this book was when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered Yassar Arafat, the President of the Palestinean Authority, basically everything he had asked for (in return for peace), yet his offer was swiftly rejected without so much as a counter.&nbsp; Arafat’s calculated decision to resort to violence rather than attempt to make peace was because of his tried and true formula of terrorism, which garnered Palestinians international sympathy and attention, villifying Israel as bullies and agressors for acts of self defense.&nbsp; This book, and the context with which it was written, bolster my paper by providing a clear example of a country doing everything within its power to do the right thing and make compromises, and an opposing government refusing to cooperate in the slightest.</p>
<p>Goldstone, Richard. “Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and War Crimes.” <em>The Washington Post</em>, WP Company, 1 Apr.&nbsp;2011, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html">www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html</a>.</p>
<p>Goldstone wrote this op-ed as an apology for his infamous eponymous report for the United Nations Human Rights Council on the 2008-09 Gaza War.&nbsp; The original report made the false accusation that Israel and Hamas were equally guilty in targeting innocent civilians and other war atrocities.&nbsp; The report urged both parties to launch internal investigations or face international consequences.&nbsp; While it is true that Hamas purposefully killed Israeli citizens–as their <em>raison d’etre</em> is to destroy the state of Israel–Israel never committed such heinous crimes.&nbsp; Although during the war some innocent Palestinians were killed from Israeli artillery, Israel has been very remorseful and has launched numerous inquiries into these mistakes.&nbsp; The prime example cited by Goldstone in his original report was an incident in which 29 Palestinians were killed in their home by IDF shelling.&nbsp; This strike wasn’t an intentional attack on innocent Palestinian civilians as Goldstone initially claimed, rather an IDF commander incorrectly thought there was a drone, and is now under investigation. Unsurprisingly, Hamas has remained unapologetic and has not launched any internal investigations, because they have no intent on becoming more ethical and observant of international law.&nbsp; This article highlights the vast ethical chasm between Hamas and Israel, yet the United Nations eagerness to equate the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This lengthy report details all aspects of the 2014 Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&nbsp; The independent commision was compiled by former high level military officers from various countries and a former UN prosecutor.&nbsp; The account offers heavy praise on how Israel handled the 2014 Gaza unrest, saying Israel “in some respects exceeded the highest standards we set for our own nations’ militaries” and “Some of the precautions were so extensive they worried that they could become norms in international law in terms of having to fight their own battles elsewhere”.&nbsp; In contrast to the glowing review of Israel, they offer a scathing critique of Gaza and Hamas, remarking that “the entire military machinery of Hamas was embedded in civilian locations, private homes and a plethora of sensitive sites such as medical facilities, mosques and schools” and “Hamas actively sought the death of its own citizens [and] conducted a highly effective information campaign which included coercion of Gaza-based journalists”.&nbsp; This damning report shows that Israel cares more about Palestinians than Hamas does, which is their own governing body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Korn, Eugene. “Israel Caught between Emotions and the Law.” <em>New Jersey Jewish News</em>, 19 Jan.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article describes the trial of Elor Azaria, an IDF soldier who killed Abdel Fattah al-Sharif, a Palestinian terrorist.&nbsp; al-Sharif had just stabbed an Israeli soldier, and was immediately apprehended and pinned to the ground when Azaria came to the scene and shot him at point blank range.&nbsp; Israel’s military court ruled that Azaria was guilty of manslaughter, as soldiers are only allowed to use weapons in cases of self defense and this was a flagrant violation of the IDF’s code of ethics.&nbsp; The reaction of this case from Israel’s public was mixed, as Israel’s secular community applauded the high ethical standard, while Israel’s religious community was more hesitant.&nbsp; Some of Israel’s religious population believe that terrorists should not be shown mercy, and found it unjust that a 20 year old kid was being punished for merely serving and protecting Israel.&nbsp; Regardless of where one falls on the political aisle, this controversial case was monumental in setting a precedent that any action short of the IDF’s code of ethics is not just wrong but also a crime.&nbsp; This article is an incredible voucher for the integrity of the Israeli court system and the self reflective nature of Israeli society.</p>
<p>Sudilovsky, Judith. “Treating the Enemy.” <em>The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com</em>, 27 May 2014, <a href="http://www.jpost.com/jerusalem-report/the-region/treating-the-enemy-354474">www.jpost.com/jerusalem-report/the-region/treating-the-enemy-354474</a>.</p>
<p>This article discusses the peculiar relationship between Israelis and Syrians.&nbsp; Although Israel and Syria are not friendly by any measure, due to Syria’s horrific civil war Israel has taken the initiative to treat injured Syrians, even undertaking operations where IDF soldiers put their lives at risk in search and rescue missions.&nbsp; Since Israel saw that more and more Syrians were coming to the border seeking medical attention they built a makeshift hospital to treat and accommodate them.&nbsp; The article documents the testimony of a Syrian grandmother who brought her grandchildren to Israel after they were severely injured in bombing attacks in their village.&nbsp; She says that she always thought that “Israel wants to kill us, to murder us, but now Israel is being more merciful to us [than Syria]”.&nbsp; The article stresses the plight of the rebels, who are not allowed medical treatment in Syria, and any doctor suspected of providing treatment is subject to death.&nbsp; This article portrays Israel in a very positive light, doing anything within their power to help the Syrians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silberman, Justin, et al.&nbsp;“Caring for Enemy Soldiers a Fundamental IDF Value.” <em>Baltimore Jewish Times</em>, 6 July 2017, <a href="http://www.jewishtimes.com/63759/caring-for-enemy-soldiers-a-fundamental-idf-value/opinion/">www.jewishtimes.com/63759/caring-for-enemy-soldiers-a-fundamental-idf-value/opinion</a></p>
<p>This article unpacks the cognitive dissonance experienced by Itzhak Brook, a former IDF medic during the 1967 Six Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War.&nbsp; Brook recalls that during the first three days of the Six Day War he took care of over 500 wounded soldiers, many of them being Jordanian or Egyptian, the very people who were attempting to wipe Israel off of the face of the earth.&nbsp; However, prior to viewing them as the enemy he viewed them as human beings, and gave them the same medical attention he gave Israelis despite his qualms.&nbsp; The opposing soldiers were frightened when Brook cared for them, becuase they had been indoctrinated by anti-semitic rhetoric and knew that Israeli prisoners of war were treated in a very different fashion.&nbsp; Brook closes his piece by urging those whom he treated to be champions for peace and use their testimonies to illustrate that coexisting with Israelis is possible and can even be beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
