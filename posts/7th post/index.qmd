The United States and China have always had a tumultuous relationship, dating all the way back to October 1949, when the People's Republic of China was established. Since the inception of the new regime China has perpetually been a violator of human rights and proponent of communism, flagrant violations of core American values and principles. U.S. China tensions coalesced into an all out trade war when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016. Trump laid the groundwork for a major conflict with China all throughout his presidential campaign, when he consistently singled out China for manipulating their currency and stealing American jobs and technology. Trump went so for as to say that the trade deal with China was 'the greatest theft in the history of the world' and that China was 'raping' America. Trump's protectionist, 'America first' platform promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and reduce the seemingly insurmountable trade deficit.

Tensions between the two world powers escalated in March of 2018, when Trump implemented extensive tariffs worth over 50 billion dollars on American imports such as aluminum and steel in an effort to protect national security and strengthen domestic industry. A few weeks later Trump followed that up with even harsher tariffs, this time focusing on clothing, electronics, and Chinese investment. China responded to the aggressive measures with tariffs of their own, officially beginning the trade war. In July of 2018 Trump intensified the trade war with additional tariffs valued at 34 billion dollars on Chinese goods, which was immediately met by China enforcing tariffs that were also 34 billion dollars. After trade talks broke down between the U.S. and China in May of 2019 Trump rose tariffs from 10% to 25% and banned U.S. companies from using telecommunication equipment produced by Chinese firms, claiming it posed a threat to national security. Unsurprisingly, China retaliated by increasing tariffs on more than 60 billion dollars worth of U.S. goods.

On January 15, 2020 America and China made major progress towards resolving the trade dispute, agreeing on a landmark deal that eased tariffs between the hostile countries. The 'Phase One' deal included reduced tariffs by the U.S. on Chinese imports and the commitment from China to purchase 200 billion dollars worth of American goods and to be more diligent in protecting the United States' intellectual property. Although there was hope of further negotiations between America and China to reconcile their feud, the global pandemic has squashed any of those aspirations. Covid-19 exacerbated the already strained U.S. China relationship, with Trump enacting a Chinese travel ban, constantly referring to Covid-19 as the 'Chinese virus', and repeatedly criticizing the handling of the pandemic by China along with the WHO (World Health Organization). However, due to the depressed economic conditions and health crises caused by the pandemic China and the U.S. have temporarily lessened tariffs.

The Unites States trade war with China has delivered mixed results for the two world powers, and while neither country appears as a clear winner, both countries look like potential losers. According to studies by the United Nations, the brunt of the tariffs have been felt by U.S. consumers and firms, who have been forced to pay much higher prices for Chinese goods. Additionally, although in 2019 Trump managed to reduce the trade deficit for the first time since 2013, the U.S. economy grew by a meager 2.3%, its lowest rate in three years. Tariffs were also damaging to China's economy, causing their exports to fall by 25% in the first half of 2019 which equated to the loss of 35 billion dollars. Also, China reported economic growth of 6.1% in 2019 from the previous year, their lowest rate in 29 years, sparking major concerns over the consequences of the trade war. Although both the U.S. and China have suffered in the short term, other countries have benefited in a major way. A couple countries reaping the rewards of the trade war include Mexico and Vietnam, who in the first half of 2019 saw a 6% and 33% respective uptick in goods exported to the U.S. Furthermore, a bulk of the 35 billion dollars China has squandered due to the tariffs have been dispersed among an assortment of countries, most notably Taiwan (\$4.2 billion), Mexico (\$3.5 billion) and Vietnam (\$2.6 billion). Although it is too early to determine all the effects of the trade war, future prospects do not look good.

Impacts of the trade war threaten to unravel the fabric of international relations and permanently alter the global hierarchy. According to simulations by the WTO (World Trade Organization), the U.S. China trade war will result in approximately a .5% decrease in global GDP and about a 2% decline in global trade by 2023. Although these projections of mere percentage points may seem insignificant, they are effectively predicting that hyper globalization will be replaced by a new era of 'slowbalisation', a term coined by The Economist to stress the slowdown of globalization. Since the 1980's the global economy has experienced an epoch of hyper globalization primarily due to neoliberal foreign policies promoting free trade. The free market approach adopted during this period was the main catalyst for the unprecedented explosion of global GDP and FDI. However, it appears as though the global economy is now heading in a different direction, one of stricter regulation and with an emphasis on regionalization.

The trade war coupled with the pandemic has ushered in a new global wave of protectionism, with countries focusing on building domestic supply chains rather than allocating resources abroad. When the Hubei province of China was under lockdown during the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, there was a supply shock which reverberated throughout the entire world. Countries around the globe are re-evaluating their dependency on China, especially for essentials goods such as military and medical supplies. Countries are attempting to become more self sufficient in all facets of production, opting to localize and reshore supply chains rather than relying on countries thousands of miles away. However, this 'regional revolution' will inevitably create a power vacuum as global powers retreat within the confines of their own borders. This void will likely be filled by China as it attempt to consolidate its power and become more of a global force. A prime example of this is illustrated by the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), a trade agreement between China and 14 other Asian-Pacific countries (including a few U.S. allies) which was signed in November of 2020. This deal is the largest trade agreement in history and is notable as China is beginning to fill the absence left by the U.S. as it pursues its 'America first' approach.

Although it is yet to be seen what path president-elect Joe Biden will take in regards to China, it appears as though the U.S. and China are entering the beginning of a quasi-cold war. It is inconceivable that in this day and age the world's two most dominant countries would engage in a legitimate cold war similar to that of the Soviet Union and U.S. in the 20th century, as they are too ensconced in each others economies as a result of globalization. However, the future will likely include an iron curtain between the East and West in terms of innovation, with the U.S. and China refusing to share with each other technological breakthroughs for fear of theft and exploitation.
