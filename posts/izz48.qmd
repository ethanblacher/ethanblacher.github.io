There is often confusion regarding the events that preceded and followed Israel's establishment on May 14, 1948. For Jews, 1948 is recalled upon fondly as they reconquered their ancient homeland, fulfilling a 2,000 year old dream. However, Palestinian Arabs' have a much different recollection of 1948, which is often referred to as 'The *Nakba',* arabic for catastrophe. Journalists and political pundits have tried to give us a clear answer and understanding of what actually transpired during Israel's struggle for independence, often painting a very black and white picture. The discussion surrounding 1948 typically revolves around the 'fact' that Israel colonized Palestine and ethnically cleansed Palestinian Arabs. This false and dishonest portrayal of reality is ubiquitous amongst western society and is especially prevalent on college campuses. Although criticism of Israel is warranted and necessary, unfair accusations border on anti-semitic.

Thomas Freidman, a prolific author and *New York Times* columnist, eloquently stated, "Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitic, and saying so is vile. But singling out Israel for opprobrium and international sanction-out of all proportion to any other party in the Middle East-is anti-Semitic, and not saying so is dishonest." 

Before understanding the geopolitics that surrounded 1948, it is important to have a brief history of the land of Israel. The story of the land of Israel begins with Abraham, the founding father of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. According to biblical lore, God sent Abraham to the land of Israel, previously called *Canaan*, to found a nation. Many years later, Moses led the Jewish people back to the 'promised land' of Israel, establishing a Jewish kingdom in Israel. The Jews in Ancient Israel faced struggles of their own, often fighting battles with neighboring civilization. The Jews were faced with their first existential threat around 720 B.C.E., when they were overthrown by the Assyrian Empire. Shortly after the Jews defeated the Assyrian's and reconquered their land, Israel was captured again by King Nebuchadnezzer of Babylonia in 586 B.C.E. Although the Jews eventually regained control later in the century, they would withstand trials and tribulations for the next half millennia. The most notable battle came courtesy of the Greeks in what would later be remembered as *Hannukah*. However, in 70 C.E. the Jewish Kingdom was ultimately toppled by Titus and the Romans, who sieged and burned Jerusalem, the physical and spiritual nucleus of Israel. In an act of disrespect to the Jews, the Romans renamed Israel 

'Palestine', after the Jews' arch-rival the Philistines, which literally translates to 'invaders.' From the time the Jews were expelled from their land until their triumphant return in 1948, the land of Israel had been under constant colonial rule--beginning with the Roman Empire, continuing with the Byzantine Empire, followed by the Ottoman Empire and culminating with the British Mandate. One common misnomer surrounding Israel is that the land was colonized by the Jews, when that is precisely the opposite of what actually occurred. The Jews liberated Palestine from the fetters of colonialism, driving out the British forces and ensuring that Palestine would once again be ruled by a native people. 

While it is abundantly clear that Jews have a deep historical link to the land of Israel, they have a contemporary legal claim to the land as well. Although during the first half of the 20th century many European Jews fled to Palestine to escape pogroms and persecution, it is a blatant fallacy to generalize all Israeli Jews with those who came from Europe. Ever since Moses brought the Israelites into Israel, Jews have maintained a constant presence in the land. In fact, Jerusalem has been a majority Jewish since the earliest British polls were taken in the 1800s. In addition to Jerusalem, many other major cities such as Safed, Acre, and Hebron contained a significant Jewish population far before 

Palestine experienced an influx of European Jews. Furthermore, the Jews who came from Europe were very diligent to acquire land legally in order to quell any notion that they 'stole land.' In the early 1900s, a majority of the land was owned by wealthy, absentee Arab landlords, while only a small portion was owned by local *fellahin* (Arab famers) and Jews. Despite all the Arabs desperate to sell their property, Jews made a concerted effort to heavily compensate Palestinians from whom they bought land, which was often arid and malaria infested. In 1944, a few years before Israel's independence, Jews paid on average around \$1,000 per acre of land in Palestine, while fertile soil in Iowa only cost approximately \$110 per acre. Additionally, Jews specifically bought land from Arabs who did not live in Palestine, rather than from the local *fellahin* in an attempt to not displace the local people. 

Jews received a major catalyst in their quest for statehood on November 2, 1917, when British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour proclaimed support for a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine. The Balfour declaration gave Jews a legitimate promise for statehood from the very country who ruled the territory: Britain. Despite the Balfour Declaration, the Jews had a very contentious relationship with the British, who instituted an immigration quota on Jews entering Palestine. Known as the White Paper, this legislature prevented Jews being persecuted in Europe to escape the Holocaust. In acts of protest and rebellion, Jews committed acts of terrorism against the British, most infamously with the bombing of the King David Hotel. Although Israeli Jews were not friendly with the British, they enlisted in the British army to fight the Axis powers. This was the basis of David Ben Gurion's famous statement, "We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper." While the Jews supported the Allies, Palestinian leadership supported Hitler and his solution to the 'Jewish question.' Haj Amin al-Huesseini, the grand mufti of Jerusalem, inquired of Hitler to eradicate Jews from Israel in alignment with the "racial interests of the Arabs and along lines similar to those used to solve the Jewish question in Germany." Despite the Arabs' overt support for the Axis powers, they were awarded about half of Palestine in the U.N. Partition Plan. U.N. Resolution 181, which divided the Mandate of Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state, was quickly accepted by the Jews even though it did not meet all of their criteria. However, due to the Arabs' delusional and insulting expectation that they would receive the entire Mandate of Palestine, they completely rejected the proposal. 

On May 14, 1948 David Ben-Gurion declared statehood, re-establishing a Jewish state in Israel after a nearly 2,000 year hiatus. Immediately after Ben-Gurion declared independence, Israel was attacked by five countries, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, a high ranking Egyptian emissary and politician stated, "This will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades." In a war of self defense, Israel ultimately prevailed against its Arab neighbors and prevented their attempted genocide of Israeli Jews. Although Israel managed to defy the odds, the win came at the hefty cost of 1% of their population. Another consequence of the war was that roughly 700,000 Palestinians were displaced, a tragedy whose ramifications are still felt today. 

Although this is a complicated issue in which both the Israelis and Arab countries are at fault, the blame is often solely put on Israel. While some Palestinians were expelled by the *Haganah* (Israeli army), a substantial number were encouraged to relocate and even ordered to evacuate by the invading countries. The prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, said that the Arab armies, "forced them \[Palestinians\] to emigrate and to leave their home-land and then threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live." The media's endeavor to manipulate and politicize the suffering of the Palestinian people in an effort to demonize Israel is morally reprehensible and disingenuous. When discussing the plight of the Palestinians, it is important to frame it in an appropriate manner and not cast Israel as the root for all of their suffering.
