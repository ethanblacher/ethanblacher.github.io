    For as long as I can remember I have followed a simple, but effective, formula: work hard, do well, repeat. It got me through school with good grades, respectable standardized test scores, and meaningful jobs and volunteer opportunities. Everything was going to plan, until the Dodgers lost the World Series. 
    The Dodgers were playing the Red Sox when my rabbi coaxed me into a bet. Although the Red Sox were the undisputed favorites, being a diehard Dodgers fan I was confident they would be able to defy the odds. The terms of the wager were as follows: if the Dodgers won the World Series my rabbi would take me to a steakhouse, where anything on the menu was fair game. If, however, the Red Sox won, I would have to learn an entire volume of Talmud, which is the primary rabbinic text of Jewish law and theology. I took the bet believing God was a Dodgers fan. It turned out, God preferred Talmud. 
    To my chagrin, the Red Sox easily defeated the Dodgers and I began studying Talmud. The experience was frustrating at first, with seemingly endless footnotes, abstract ideas, and complex debates. Yet, the very fact that everything about it was difficult actually compelled me to work even harder. Words, expressions, and arguments I may have passed over in other contexts suddenly and surprisingly became meaningful to me. I had to focus and consider everything. For the first time I found reward in the struggle, rather than in the outcome. I learned to love the intricacies of the Talmud so much that I brought the tome everywhere I went: to school, friends' homes, and ultimately on a school trip to Poland. 
    As I walked among the 17,000 jagged stones that serve as a symbolic cemetery in honor of those murdered at Treblinka, I felt connected to the past in a way that I had never experienced before. I saw a stone with the word ‘Płock’ etched across the front. Płock was the Polish town where all my family lived before the Holocuast. I sat down alone on the damp pavement beside the stone with my Talmud. Being able to enjoy this sacred text in the same place where not long ago Jews were slaughtered for simply being Jewish was an empowering experience. It made me realize that I needed to rewrite my plans for college and the next chapter of my life. 
    I had already applied, and been accepted, to several of my top choices. But as I sat pondering the past and my future, I felt a yearning to alter the journey I had so carefully planned. Just then a hand gently clutched my shoulder. I swiveled my head around and saw that it was my rabbi. We discussed the need for every person to find his or her own path. Unexpectedly, mine would take me to a gap a year in Jerusalem, where I will deepen my knowledge of Judaism, immerse myself in a different culture, and learn to be more independent before returning to college in the United States. At the end of our conversation my rabbi asked if we could study together. I placed the Talmud between us and replied, “You bet.”
