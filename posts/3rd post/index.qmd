	As an avid ice cream enthusiast, I often found myself in the frozen section of my local grocery store, contemplating which dairy treat I would enjoy next. The bright fluorescent bulbs bathed the names of the numerous brands and flavors in a golden glow, each one seemingly pleading its case to be eaten. Raspberry cheesecake, s’mores, and chocolate fudge brownie all called my name, but the loudest call of all was always chocolate chip cookie dough. Chocolate chip cookie dough was like a best friend, for it was always there for me (buried in my freezer) and never failed to make me feel better when I needed it most.  
	However, my relationship with ice cream experienced tremendous turmoil at the start of my sophomore year when I was diagnosed with celiac disease. When people with celiac disease eat gluten, their small intestine is attacked, making them unable to absorb important nutrients, which can lead to severe health issues and complications. My doctor informed me that I had the most severe case of celiac he had ever seen and if I didn’t immediately stop eating gluten, I would be at an extremely high risk of cancer before turning 20.
	In merely a few hours my whole life was turned upside down;  I was forbidden to indulge in my favorite foods: never again could I devour piles of pasta, inhale sixteen inch pizza pies, or scarf down pints of cookie dough ice cream. I was devastated. That night I found myself back in the formerly friendly confines of the supermarket’s frozen section. However, no flavors that looked good were gluten free (GF) and no gluten free flavors looked good. I was sullenly dragging my feet down the aisle when I spotted a delectable looking cookie dough package with a GF sticker plastered across its packaging. Instantly, I remembered that sitting on the third shelf of our pantry behind the menorah was an old ice cream maker. In that moment I realized I had two choices: I could either feel sorry for myself or I could adapt. I bought the GF cookie dough, heavy cream, vanilla extract, granulated sugar and whole milk: all the ingredients I needed to make ice cream. I ran home and pulled out the dusty machine. I was not much of a cook, in fact I had hardly cooked anything besides packaged risotto, so this experience was both new and empowering. I mixed the ingredients together carefully, froze my creation for two hours, and paced the kitchen. When my timer went off I delicately placed my spoon in the melting dairy treat and took a taste. It was delicious. With each bite that followed, I felt more and more confident that all I needed was a positive attitude. Stepping out of my comfort zone could be as easy as pie… or cookie dough. I was forever changed by ice cream. 
	Before making my GF chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, I thought my ice-cream-craving heart would be forever broken. Instead, I was able to begin my new chapter of being gluten free with an enhanced and strengthened relationship with ice cream.  Now, ice cream is my inspiration. I saunter down the frozen section, eyeing my former delights, and dream of what I can whip up next.
