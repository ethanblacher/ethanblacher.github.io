    Environmentalism and Judaism have deep roots, traceable all the way back to the inception of the Jewish people.  A prime example of Judaism’s dedication to preserving the environment comes from one of the greatest rabbinic sages, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai, who remarked, “If you have a sapling in your hand and someone tells you the Messiah has arrived, first plant the sapling and then go out to welcome the Messiah”. The importance of planting trees on this planet, even the smallest seedlings, takes precedence over greeting the person who will usher in the utopian ‘world to come’.  Judaism’s deeply ingrained sense of awe and responsibility for the natural world spurned early Zionists leaders to ponder the environmental impact they wanted to have when they returned to their ancient homeland.  This sentiment culminated with the birth of the Jewish National Fund.   
    The Jewish National Fund, also referred to as Keren Kayemet LeYisrael in Hebrew, is a non-profit organization that was founded at the Fifth Zionist Congress in 1901 by the father of modern Zionism, Theodore Herzl.  The Jewish National Fund begun by purchasing land in Ottoman ruled Palestine from absentee Arab landlords, usually paying a steep premium for those lands.  The Jewish National Fund made a concerted effort to heavily compensate Palestinians from whom they bought land, which was often arid and malaria infested.  In 1944, a few years before Israel’s independence, Jews paid on average around $1,000 per acre of land in Palestine, while fertile soil in Iowa only costed approximately $110 per acre.   Additionally, Jews specifically bought land from Arabs who did not live in Palestine, rather than from the local fellahin (farmers).  David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, went as for as to say, “under no circumstances must we touch land belonging to fellahs or worked by them”.  Slowly but surely the Jewish National Fund amassed a small fortune of land in the British Mandate of Palestine, and in 1939 10% of the entire Israeli Jewish population lived on Jewish National Fund owned land.  That same year, Britain’s prime minister, Neville Chamberlin, instituted quotas on Jewish land acquisition and Jewish immigration.  Despite the British White Paper, the Jewish National Fund continued to gradually buy land where it was permitted.  Following the United Nations Partition Plan (Resolution 181) and Israel’s subsequent War of Independence, the Jewish National Fund began to procure and develop tremendous amounts of land, and currently owns 13% of the land in Israel.  Since its commencement more than a century ago, the Jewish National Fund has blossomed from an idea into a reality, having a significant impact in shaping Israel’s ecological landscape.
    According to the Environmental Justice Atlas, the intent of the Jewish National Fund’s afforestation projects is to “hide the ethnic cleansing of those Palestinians whose home it was, and to prevent Palestinians from returning to their homes.”  However, these claims are both misleading and false for multiple reasons.  The accusation of a Palestinian ‘ethnic cleansing’ is common rhetoric that is used in attempt to defame Israel.  The truth of the matter is that on May 14, 1948 David Ben-Gurion declared statehood, re-establishing a Jewish state in Israel after a nearly 2,000 year hiatus.  Immediately after Ben-Gurion declared independence Israel was attacked by five countries, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.  Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, a high ranking Egyptian emissary and politician stated, “This will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades”.  In a war of self defense, Israel ultimately prevailed against its Arab neighbors and prevented their attempted genocide of Israeli Jews. One consequence of the war was that roughly 700,000 Palestinians were displaced, a tragedy whose ramifications are still felt today.  Although this is a complicated issue in which both the Israelis and Arab countries are at fault, the Environmental Justice Atlas emphatically places the blame solely on Israel.  While some Palestinians were expelled by the Haganah (Israeli army), a substantial amount were encouraged to relocate and even ordered to evacuate by the invading countries. The prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, said that the Arab armies, “forced them to emigrate and to leave their home-land and the threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live.”  The Environmental Justice Atlas’s endeavor to manipulate and politicize the suffering of the Palestinian people in an effort to demonize Israel is morally reprehensible and disingenuous.  
    In an effort to redeem Israel’s dry and barren terrain, the Jewish National Fund was forced to be creative.  The Jewish National Fund is a strong proponent of geo-engineering, as it is responsible for planting over 250 million trees, constructing more than 200 dams and reservoirs, and creating over 1,000 parks.  While the need for geo-engineering is becoming more dire around the globe, countries such as the Netherlands and Israel are pioneers in the field, and are implementing geo-engineering in their respective societies on large scales.  However, while the Netherland’s Benthemplein Square is lauded for being ‘innovative’, ‘attractive’, and ‘inspiring,’ Israel is excoriated.  It is alleged that the Jewish National Fund is culpable for ‘greenwashing’, which is using environmental prowess and accomplishments to minimize injustices occurring elsewhere within the society.  Israel is no stranger to these types of allegations, as it is often accused of similar offenses such as ‘pinkwashing’, where critics lambast Israel for exploiting its robust LGBTQ community in order to conceal its human rights violations.  A large reason why Israel is castigated for being so environmentally friendly and innovative is due to the messy past of the environmental movement. Environmentalism has an atrocious history of racism, sexism, and classism, issues that still persist today.  For instance, a couple of the most notable and influential conservationists, John Muir and Aldo Leopold, were bigoted white males with extremely racist ideologies.  While it is completely legitimate and valid to be cautiously suspicious of environmental movements and their motives, the skepticism coupled with the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict has led many environmentalists and humanitarians to the inaccurate conclusion that Israel is guilty of ‘greenwashing’.  The Jewish National Fund is the realization of the Zionist dream, which is the self determination of the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland.  This mission does not impede on the Palestinian, Druze, Bedouin and other indigenous peoples who regard Israel as their native land.  It is abundantly clear that although the Jewish National Fund is in a precarious situation due to the conflicting claims to the land, it does not have an oppressive agenda and has taken appropriate steps in acting as ethically as possible.
    The Environmental Justice Atlas also proclaims that Israel is developing the Negev (southern, desert region of Israel) at the “expense of more than 150,000 Palestinian Bedouin, whose ‘unrecognised’ villages, as a direct result of Israel’s policies, already lack electricity, running water and sewage disposal.”  The Bedouins are Israel’s poorest people, with more than half of Bedouin workers earning the minimum wage or lower.  This is largely due to the fact that the Negev is Israel’s most impoverished region and much of the land has been developed into military sites and national parks.  Furthermore, high unemployment, drug and crime rates among the Bedouins are exacerbating their economic plight.  However, the myriad of issues plaguing the Bedouins does not stem from the Jewish National Fund, and the Jewish National Fund is taking multiple steps to alleviate the hardships the Bedouin people encounter.  During the summer of 2014, Gaza bombarded Israel with heavy rocket fire, with Bedouins occasionally caught up in the crossfire.  The Jewish National Fund responded to the bombings by creating programing and bomb shelters to help calm and keep Bedouin children safe.  Additionally, since the Bedouins live in a region of Israel that contains only 8% of its total population, there is a lack of resources and services.  In an effort to combat the lack of hospitals deep in the Negev, the Jewish National Fund built a medical center to ensure the Bedouins get the treatment they need.  
    One of the hallmarks of the Jewish National Fund has been its vast afforestation projects, which serve a crucial environmental role.  Carbon dioxide rates are currently the highest (over 400 parts per million) in human history and show no indication of slowing down (as illustrated by the Keeling Curve), especially due to the loss of carbon sinks via deforestation and rising ocean temperatures.  The Jewish National Fund is the main reason why Israel is one of the only nations in the world to have more trees now than a hundred years ago, a remarkable achievement especially in a region that is regularly plagued by drought.  Due to the relatively scare natural resources of the Levant, Israel’s manmade forests serve as vital carbon sinks in addition to agricultural land for the local populations.  One of the populations that derives substantial benefit from the Yatir Forest (the largest planted forest in Israel) are the Bedouins, who utilize the forest for crops, grazing for their livestock, and as a source of income.  Contrary to popular belief, the Jewish National fund has partnered extensively with Bedouins in the Yatir Forest, providing much needed assistance to the underprivileged minority.  For example, Bedouins are permitted to let their herds graze on the plentiful pastures at a heavily discounted rate, with experts estimating that Bedouin herders save up to $56,637 (USD) in flock expenses.  Although the grazing arrangement may not make sense for Israel from an economic standpoint, the herds play an important role in eating undergrowth vegetation, providing vital fire control.  Additionally, Bedouins in Hebron use the Yatir Forest to harvest wild artichokes, hyssop, and firewood.  Wild artichoke is a crucial crop for the Palestinian Bedouins, as when they are in season they can net a collector up to $64 (USD) a day, double the wage of some professional occupations in Hebron.  Although it is technically illegal, the Israeli’s turn a blind eye to the reapers, and the artichoke has been coined ‘green gold’ due to its high profit margins and widespread availability.  Overall, the Yatir Forest is responsible for over $300,000 (USD) worth of income for the Bedouin community residing in the Negev and in Hebron.  Although $300,000 may seem relatively insignificant when compared to the 28,000 Bedouin population in these regions, the Yatir Forest offers consistent economic and resource insurance, which is essential in a war-ravaged country.
